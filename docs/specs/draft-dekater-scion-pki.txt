Abstract

   This document presents the trust concept and design of the SCION
   _Control Plane Public Key Infrastructure (CP-PKI)_. SCION
   (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-generation networks) is
   a path-aware, inter-domain network architecture where the Control
   Plane PKI handles cryptographic material and lays the foundation for
   the authentication procedures in SCION.  It is used by SCION's
   Control Plane to authenticate and verify path information, and
   provisions SCION's trust model based on Isolation Domains.

   This document describes the trust model behind the SCION Control
   Plane PKI, including specifications of the different types of
   certificates and the Trust Root Configuration.  It also specifies how
   to deploy the Control Plane PKI infrastructure.

   This document contains new approaches to secure path aware
   networking.  It is not an Internet Standard, has not received any
   formal review of the IETF, nor was the work developed through the
   rough consensus process.  The approaches offered in this work are
   offered to the community for its consideration in the further
   evolution of the Internet.

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


1.  Introduction

   SCION is a path-aware internetworking routing architecture as
   described in [RFC9217].  It allows endpoints and applications to
   select paths across the network to use for traffic, based on
   trustworthy path properties.  SCION is an inter-domain network
   architecture and is therefore not concerned with intra-domain
   forwarding.

   SCION has been developed with the following goals:

   _Availability_ - to provide highly available communication that can
   send traffic over paths with optimal or required characteristics,
   quickly handle inter-domain link or router failures (both on the last
   hop or anywhere along the path) and provide continuity in the
   presence of adversaries.

   _Security_ - to introduce a new approach to inter-domain path
   security that leverages path awareness in combination with a unique
   trust model.  The goal is to provide higher levels of trust in
   routing information to prevent traffic hijacking, and enable users to
   decide where their data travels based on routing information that can
   be unambiguously attributed to an AS, ensuring that packets are only
   forwarded along authorized path segments.  A particular use case is
   to enable geofencing.

   _Scalability_ - to improve the scalability of the inter-domain
   control plane and data plane, avoiding existing limitations related
   to convergence and forwarding table size.  The advertising of path
   segments is separated into a beaconing process within each Isolation
   Domain (ISD) and between ISDs which incurs minimal overhead and
   resource requirements on routers.

   SCION relies on three main components:

   _PKI_ - To achieve scalability and trust, SCION organizes existing
   ASes into logical groups of independent routing planes called
   _Isolation Domains (ISDs)_. All ASes in an ISD agree on a set of
   trust roots called the _Trust Root Configuration (TRC)_ which is a
   collection of signed root certificates in X.509 v3 format [RFC5280].
   The ISD is governed by a set of _core ASes_ which typically manage
   the trust roots and provide connectivity to other ISDs.  This is the
   basis of the public key infrastructure used for the authentication of
   messages used by the SCION Control Plane.

   _Control Plane_ - performs inter-domain routing by discovering and
   securely disseminating path information between ASes.  The core ASes
   use Path-segment Construction Beacons (PCBs) to explore intra-ISD
   paths, or to explore paths across different ISDs.

   _Data Plane_ - carries out secure packet forwarding between SCION-
   enabled ASes over paths selected by endpoints.  A SCION border router
   reuses existing intra-domain infrastructure to communicate to other
   SCION routers or SCION endpoints within its AS.

   This document describes the SCION PKI component used by the Control
   Plane.  It should be read in conjunction with the other components
   [I-D.dekater-scion-controlplane] and [I-D.dekater-scion-dataplane].

   The SCION architecture was initially developed outside of the IETF by
   ETH Zurich with significant contributions from Anapaya Systems.  It
   is deployed in the Swiss finance sector to provide resilient
   connectivity between financial institutions.  The aim of this
   document is to document the existing protocol specification as
   deployed, to encourage interoperability among implementations, and to
   introduce new concepts that can potentially be further improved to
   address particular problems with the current Internet architecture.

   Note (to be removed before publication): this document, together with
   the other components [I-D.dekater-scion-controlplane] and
   [I-D.dekater-scion-dataplane], deprecates
   [I-D.dekater-panrg-scion-overview].

1.1.  Terminology

   *Control Plane PKI (CP-PKI)*: The control plane PKI is the public-key
   infrastructure upon which SCION's Control Plane relies for the
   authentication of messages.  It is a set of policies, roles, and
   procedures that are used to manage trust root configurations (TRCs)
   and certificates.

   *Autonomous System (AS)*: An autonomous system is a network under a
   common administrative control.  For example, the network of an
   Internet service provider or organization can constitute an AS.

   *Isolation Domain (ISD)*: In SCION, Autonomous Systems (ASes) are
   organized into logical groups called isolation domains or ISDs.  Each
   ISD consists of ASes that span an area with a uniform trust
   environment (i.e., a common jurisdiction).  A possible model is for
   ISDs to be formed along national boundaries or federations of
   nations.

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   *Core AS*: Each isolation domain (ISD) is administered by a set of
   distinguished autonomous systems (ASes) called core ASes, which are
   responsible for initiating the path discovery and path construction
   process known as "beaconing".

   *Trust Root Configuration (TRC)*: A Trust Root Configuration or TRC
   is a signed collection of certificates pertaining to an isolation
   domain (ISD).  TRCs also contain ISD-specific policies.

   *Authoritative AS*: Authoritative ASes are those ASes in an ISD that
   always have the latest TRCs of the ISD.  As a consequence,
   authoritative ASes also start the announcement of a TRC update.

   *Base TRC*: A base TRC is a trust root configuration (TRC) that other
   parties trust axiomatically.  In other words, trust for a base TRC is
   assumed, not derived from another cryptographic object.  Each ISD
   MUST create and sign a base TRC when the ISD is established.  A base
   TRC is either the first TRC of the ISD or the result of a trust
   reset.

   *TRC Signing Ceremony*: The ceremony during which the very first base
   TRC of an ISD, called the initial TRC, is signed.  The initial TRC is
   a special case of the base TRC where the number of the ISD is
   assigned.

   *TRC Update*: A _regular_ TRC update is a periodic re-issuance of the
   TRC where the entities and policies listed in the TRC remain
   unchanged.  A _sensitive_ TRC update is an update that modifies
   critical aspects of the TRC, such as the set of core ASes.  In both
   cases, the base TRC remains unchanged.

   *Voting ASes*: Those ASes within an ISD that may sign TRC updates.
   The process of appending a signature to a new TRC is called "casting
   a vote".

   *Voting Quorum*: The voting quorum is a trust root configuration
   (TRC) field that indicates the number of votes (signatures) needed on
   a successor TRC for it to be verifiable.  A voting quorum greater
   than one will thus prevent a single entity from creating a malicious
   TRC update.

   *Grace Period*: The grace period is an interval during which the
   previous version of a trust root configuration (TRC) is still
   considered active after a new version has been published.

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   *Trust Reset*: A trust reset is the action of announcing a new base
   TRC for an existing ISD.  A trust reset SHOULD only be triggered
   after a catastrophic event involving the loss or compromise of
   several important private keys.

1.2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Trust Model

   Given the diverse nature of the constituents in the current Internet,
   an important challenge is how to scale authentication of network
   elements (such as AS ownership, hop-by-hop routing information, name
   servers for DNS, and domains for TLS) to the global environment.  The
   roots of trust of currently prevalent public key infrastructure (PKI)
   models do not scale well to a global environment because (1) mutually
   distrustful parties cannot agree on a single trust root (monopoly
   model), and because (2) the security of a plethora of roots of trust
   is only as strong as its weakest link (oligopoly model) - see also
   [BARRERA17].

   The monopoly model suffers from two main drawbacks: First, all
   parties must agree on a single root of trust.  Secondly, the single
   root of trust represents a single point of failure, the misuse of
   which enables the forging of certificates.  Its revocation can also
   result in a kill switch for all the entities it certifies.

   The oligopoly model relies on several roots of trust, all equally and
   completely trusted.  However, this is not automatically better:
   whereas the monopoly model has a single point of failure, the
   oligopoly model has the drawback of exposing more than one point of
   failure.

   Thus, there is a need for a trust architecture that supports
   meaningful trust roots in a global environment with inherently
   distrustful parties.  This new trust architecture should provide the
   following properties:

   *  Trust agility (see further below);

   *  Resilience to single root of trust compromise;

   *  Multilateral governance; and



de Kater, et al.          Expires 10 March 2026                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   *  Support for policy versioning and updates.

   Ideally, the trust architecture allows parties that mutually trust
   each other to form their own trust "union" or "domain", and to freely
   decide whether to trust other trust unions (domains) outside their
   own trust bubble.

   To fulfill the above requirements, which in fact apply well to inter-
   domain networking, SCION introduces the concept of *Isolation
   Domains*. An Isolation Domain (ISD) is a building block for achieving
   high availability, scalability, and support for heterogeneous trust.
   It consists of a logical grouping of ASes that share a uniform trust
   environment (i.e. a common jurisdiction).

   An ISD is administered by one or multiple ASes, called the *voting
   ASes*. Furthermore, each ISD has a set of ASes that form the ISD
   core; these are the *core ASes*. The set of core and voting ASes can,
   but do not necessarily have to, overlap.  It is governed by a policy
   called the *Trust Root Configuration* (TRC), which is negotiated by
   the ISD core, and which defines the locally scoped roots of trust
   used to validate bindings between names and public keys.

   Authentication in SCION is based on digital certificates that bind
   identifiers to public keys and carry digital signatures that are
   verified by roots of trust.  SCION allows each ISD to define its own
   set of trust roots, along with the policy governing their use.  Such
   scoping of trust roots within an ISD improves security as compromise
   of a private key associated with a trust root cannot be used to forge
   a certificate outside the ISD.  An ISD's trust roots and policy are
   encoded in the TRC, which has a version number, a list of public keys
   that serves as root of trust for various purposes, and policies
   governing the number of signatures required for performing different
   types of actions.  The TRC serves as a way to bootstrap all
   authentication within SCION.  Additionally, TRC versioning is used to
   efficiently revoke compromised roots of trust.

   The TRC also provides _trust agility_, that is it enables users to
   select the trust roots used to initiate certificate validation.  This
   implies that users are free to choose an ISD they believe maintains a
   uncompromised set of trust roots.  ISD members can also decide
   whether to trust other ISDs and thus transparently define trust
   relationships between parts of the network.  The SCION trust model
   therefore, differs from the one provided by other PKI architectures.

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   The need for trust agility also means that SCION does not by design
   provide IP prefix origin validation as provided by RPKI [RFC8210].
   RPKI's trust model is currently reliant on the trust roots provided
   by the five Regional Internet Registries, and therefore outside of
   the governance of an ISD.

1.4.  Trust Relations within an Isolation Domain

   As previously mentioned, the Control Plane PKI is organized at an ISD
   level whereby each ISD can independently specify its own Trust Root
   Configuration (TRC) and build its own verification chain.  Each TRC
   consists of a collection of signed root certificates, which are used
   to sign CA certificates, which are in turn used to sign AS
   certificates.  The TRC also includes ISD policies that specify, for
   example, the TRC's usage, validity, and future updates.  The so-
   called *base TRC* constitutes the ISD's trust anchor which is signed
   during a signing ceremony by the voting ASes and then distributed
   throughout the ISD.

1.4.1.  Updates and Trust Resets

   There are two types of TRC updates: regular and sensitive.  A
   *regular TRC update* is a periodic re-issuance of the TRC where the
   entities and policies listed in the TRC remain unchanged, whereas a
   *sensitive TRC update* is an update that modifies critical aspects of
   the TRC, such as the set of core ASes.  In both cases the base TRC
   remains unchanged.

   If the ISD's TRC has been compromised, it is necessary for an ISD to
   re-establish the trust root.  This is possible with a process called
   *trust reset* (if permitted by the ISD's trust policy).  In this
   case, a new base TRC is created.

1.4.2.  Substitutes to Certificate Revocation

   The Control Plane PKI does not explicitly support certificate
   revocation.  Instead it relies on the two mechanisms described above
   and on short-lived certificates.  This approach constitutes an
   attractive alternative to a revocation system for the following
   reasons:

   *  Both short-lived certificates and revocation lists must be signed
      by a CA.  Instead of periodically signing a new revocation list,
      the CA can simply re-issue all the non-revoked certificates.
      Although the overhead of signing multiple certificates is greater
      than that of signing a single revocation list, the overall
      complexity of the system is reduced.  In the Control Plane PKI the
      number of certificates that each CA must renew is manageable as it
      is limited to at most the number of ASes within an ISD.

   *  Even with a revocation system, a compromised key cannot be
      instantaneously revoked.  Through their validity period, both
      short-lived certificates and revocation lists implicitly define an
      attack window (i.e. a period during which an attacker who managed
      to compromise a key could use it before it becomes invalid).  In
      both cases, the CA must consider a tradeoff between efficiency and
      security when picking this validity period.

1.5.  Overview of Certificates, Keys, and Roles

   The base TRC constitutes the root of trust within an ISD.  Figure 1

                 Figure 1: Chain of trust within an ISD

   All certificates used in the Control plane PKI are in X.509 v3 format
   [RFC5280] and additionally the TRC contains self-signed certificates
   instead of plain public keys.  Self-signed certificates have the
   following advantages over plain public keys: (1) They make the
   binding between name and public key explicit; and (2) the binding is
   signed to prove possession of the corresponding private key.

   All ASes in SCION have the task to sign and verify control plane
   messages.  However, certain ASes have additional roles:

   *  *Core ASes*: Core ASes are a distinct set of ASes in the SCION
      Control Plane.  For each ISD, the core ASes are listed in the TRC.
      Each core AS in an ISD has links to other core ASes (in the same
      or in different ISDs).

   *  *Certification authorities (CAs)*: CAs are responsible for issuing
      AS certificates to other ASes and/or themselves.

   *  *Voting ASes*: Only certain ASes within an ISD may sign TRC
      updates.  The process of appending a signature to a new TRC is
      called "casting a vote", and the designated ASes that hold the
      private keys to sign a TRC update are "voting ASes".

   *  *Authoritative ASes*: Authoritative ASes are those ASes in an ISD
      that always have the latest TRCs of the ISD.  They start the
      announcement of a TRC update.

1.6.  Trust as a Function

   The Control Plane PKI can be seen as a function that transforms
   potential distrust among different parties into a mutually accepted
   trust contract including a trust update and reset policy as well as
   certificates used for authentication procedures in SCION's Control
   Plane.

   For the function to work, it is not necessary that the ASes of the
   ISD all trust each other.  However, all ASes MUST trust the ISD's
   core ASes, authoritative ASes, voting ASes, as well as its CA(s).
   These trusted parties negotiate the ISD trust contract in a
   "bootstrapping of trust" ceremony, where cryptographic material is
   exchanged and the ISD's trust anchor (the initial Trust Root
   Configuration) is created and signed.

1.6.1.  Input

   Prior to the ceremony, the trusted parties MUST decide about the
   validity period of the TRC as well as the number of votes required to
   update a TRC.  They MUST also bring the required keys and
   certificates, the so-called root and voting keys/certificates.

   The trusted parties require an ISD number, whose numbering scheme is
   described in [I-D.dekater-scion-controlplane] section ISD Numbers,
   and allocation in [ISD-AS-assignments].

1.6.2.  Output

   The output of the bootstrapping of trust ceremony, or the trust
   "function", are the ISD's initial Trust Root Configuration as well as
   mutually trusted and accepted CA and AS certificates - the latter are
   used to verify control plane messages.  Together with the ISD's
   control plane root certificates, the CA and AS certificates build the
   ISD's trust and verification chain.

2.  Certificate Specification

   This section provides a detailed specification of all certificates
   used by the Control Plane PKI.

2.1.  SCION Control Plane PKI Keys and Certificates - Overview

   There are three types of Control Plane (CP) certificates: root
   certificates, CA certificates, and AS certificates.  Together, they
   build a chain of trust that is anchored in the Trust Root
   Configuration (TRC) file of the respective Isolation Domain (ISD).
   Additionally, there are regular and sensitive voting certificates
   which define the keys to cast votes in a regular or sensitive TRC
   update.

   All certificates in the Control Plane PKI are in X.509 v3 format
   [RFC5280].

2.1.1.  Trust Hierarchy

   The trust is anchored in the TRC for each ISD.  The trust root is
   axiomatic: All trust derived from this anchor relies on all parties
   transitively trusting the TRC.

   The trust hierarchy looks like this:

   TRC
   ── Regular Voting Certificates
        └── TRC (next version, regular update)
   ── Sensitive Voting Certificates
        └── TRC (next version, sensitive update)
   ── CP Root Certificates
        └── CP CA Certificates
             └── CP AS Certificates

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


2.1.2.  Control Plane Root Certificate

   The private key of the Control Plane root certificate is used to sign
   Control Plane CA certificates.  Consequently, the public key of the
   Control Plane Root certificate is used to verify Control Plane CA
   certificates, i.e. root certificates determine which ASes act as a CA
   in an ISD.

   In X.509 terms, Control Plane root certificates are _self-signed_ CA
   certificates.  That is, issuer and subject of the certificate are the
   same entity, and the public key in the root certificate can be used
   to verify the root certificate's signature.  The public key of the
   Control Plane root certificate and proof of ownership of the private
   key are embedded in the TRC of an ISD, via the self-signed Control
   Plane root certificate.  This facilitates the bootstrapping of trust
   within an ISD, and marks the Control Plane root certificates as the
   starting point of an ISD's certificate verification path.

   The RECOMMENDED *maximum validity period* of a Control Plane root
   certificate is 1 year.

   *Note*: The TRC of each ISD contains a trusted set of Control Plane
   root certificates, and this set builds the root of each ISD's
   verification path.  For more information on the selection of this
   trusted set of root certificates, see Section 3.

2.1.3.  Control Plane CA Certificate

   The private key of the Control Plane CA is used to sign Control Plane
   AS certificates.  Consequently, Control Plane CA certificates holding
   the public key of the Control Plane CA are used to verify Control
   Plane AS certificates.

   The public key needed to verify the CA certificate is in a Control
   Plane root certificate.  CA certificates do not bundle the root
   certificate needed to verify them.  In order to verify a CA
   certificate, a pool of root certificates must first be extracted from
   one or more active TRCs (as described in Section 4.2).

   The RECOMMENDED *maximum validity period* of a Control Plane CA
   certificate is 11 days.

2.1.4.  Control Plane AS Certificate

   SCION ASes sign control plane messages, such as Path Construction
   Beacons, with their AS private key.  Consequently, Control Plane AS
   certificates holding the corresponding AS public key are required to
   verify control plane messages.

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   In X.509 terms, Control Plane AS certificates are end-entity
   certificates.  That is, they cannot be used to verify other
   certificates.

   The RECOMMENDED *maximum validity period* of a CP AS certificate is 3
   days.

2.1.5.  Voting Certificates

   There are two types of voting certificates: the (1) regular voting
   certificates and the (2) sensitive voting certificates.  They contain
   the public keys associated with the private keys that MAY cast votes
   in the TRC update process.  Voting certificates are X.509-style
   certificates.

   Regular and sensitive voting certificates are used to verify regular
   and sensitive TRC updates, respectively, and are embedded in the TRC.

2.1.5.1.  Regular Voting Certificate

   Regular voting certificates state which keys MAY cast votes in a
   regular update.  In X.509 terms, regular voting certificates are
   self-signed end-entity certificates.  This means that the issuer and
   subject of a regular voting certificate are the same entity, and the
   public key within the certificate can be used to verify the
   certificate's signature.  However, a regular voting certificate
   cannot be used to verify other certificates.

   The RECOMMENDED *maximum validity period* of a regular voting
   certificate is 1 year.

2.1.5.2.  Sensitive Voting Certificate

   Sensitive voting certificates specify which keys MAY cast votes in a
   sensitive update.  In X.509 terms, sensitive voting certificates are
   self-signed end-entity certificates.  This means that the issuer and
   subject of a sensitive voting certificate are the same entity, and
   the public key within the certificate can be used to verify the
   certificate's signature.  However, a sensitive voting certificate
   cannot be used to verify other certificates.

   The RECOMMENDED *maximum validity period* of a sensitive voting
   certificate is 5 years.

   *Note*:

      Both SCION Control Plane root certificates and Control Plane CA
      certificates are in fact CA certificates.  That is, they can both
      be used to verify other certificates.

      One important difference between both certificate types lies in
      their validity period: A SCION Control Plane root certificate has
      a RECOMMENDED maximum validity period of one year, whereas the
      RECOMMENDED maximum validity period of a SCION Control Plane CA
      certificate is 11 days.  This is because a root certificate is
      part of the TRC of an ISD, which itself also has a RECOMMENDED
      maximum validity period of one year (see Table 1 below).  This
      ensures that the TRC need not be updated all the time and is thus
      relatively stable.

      The SCION root private key and public key/certificate are used to
      sign and verify the Control Plane CA certificates, respectively.
      The control plane CA certificates are explicitly NOT part of the
      TRC, for reasons of security.  The Control Plane CA certificates
      are used to verify the Control Plane AS certificates, which in
      turn are used to verify control plane messages.  Routing is made
      more secure if both the SCION Control Plane CA and AS certificates
      can be renewed on a very regular basis.  If the control plane CA
      and AS certificates were part of the TRC, then the TRC would have
      to be updated constantly, which is undesirable.

2.1.6.  Certificates - Formal Overview

   Table 1 and Table 2 below provide an overview of the different types
   of key pairs and certificates in the control plane PKI.

                           Table 2: Certificates

   (1) Multiple signatures and certificates of each type MAY be included
   in a TRC.
   (2) Recommended maximum validity period.
   (3) A validity of 11 days with 4 days overlap between two CA
   certificates is RECOMMENDED to enable the best possible operational
   procedures when performing a CA certificate rollover.

      Figure 2: TRC update chain and the different types of associated
      certificates.  Arrows show how signatures are verified; in other
     words, they indicate that a public key contained in a certificate
       or TRC can be used to verify the authenticity of another item.

2.2.  Certificate Specification

   Whilst the certificates used in the Control Plane PKI are X.509 v3
   certificates, the SCION specification is more restrictive.  This
   section defines these additional constraints and conditions in
   comparison to [RFC5280].

2.2.1.  Basic Fields: SCION-Specific Constraints and Conditions

   The described fields of the Control Plane PKI certificates are
   relevant for each certificate regardless of the certificate type.
   For detailed descriptions of the full generic format of X.509 v3
   certificates, see [RFC5280] and [X.509] clause 7.2.

   TBSCertificate sequence: Contains information associated with the
   subject of the certificate and the CA that issued it.  It includes
   the following fields:

   *  version field: Describes the version of the encoded certificate.
      It MUST be set to "v3" (as extensions are REQUIRED in SCION).

   *  serialNumber field: A positive integer assigned by the CA to each
      certificate.  It MUST be unique for each certificate issued by a
      given CA.

   *  signature field: Contains the identifier for the algorithm used by
      the CA to sign the certificate.

      -  *SCION constraints*: Currently, SCION only supports the ECDSA
         signature algorithm.  The details can be found at:
         Section 2.2.1.1.

      -  *Additional conditions and remarks*: As a consequence, the
         parameters field in the AlgorithmIdentifier sequence MUST NOT
         be used.

   *  issuer field: Contains the distinguished name (DN) of the entity
      that has issued and signed the certificate (usually a CA).

      -  *SCION constraints*:

         o  This field MUST be non-empty.

         o  SCION implementations MUST ONLY use the “UTF8String” value
            type for all attributes (including the SCION-specific
            attribute ISD-AS number).

      -  *Additional conditions and remarks*: All SCION implementations
         MUST support the additional SCION-specific attribute ISD-AS
         number.  For details, see Section 2.2.1.2 and
         Section 2.2.1.2.1.

   *  validity field: Defines the validity period of the certificate.

      -  *SCION constraints*: All certificates MUST have a well-defined
         expiration date.  Certificates with a generalized time value
         are not valid and MUST be rejected.

      -  *Additional conditions and remarks*: SCION recommends a
         specific maximum validity period for each type of certificate.
         For details, see Section 2.1.6.  SCION implementations SHOULD
         adopt these values.

   *  subject field: Defines the entity that owns the certificate.

      -  *SCION constraints*:

         o  This field MUST be non-empty.

         o  SCION implementations MUST ONLY use the “UTF8String” value
            type for all attributes (including the SCION-specific
            attribute ISD-AS number).

      -  *Additional conditions and remarks*: The subject field is
         specified in the same way as the issuer field.  For details,
         see Section 2.2.1.2 and Section 2.2.1.2.1.

   *  subjectPublicKeyInfo field: Carries the public key of the
      certificate's subject (the entity that owns the certificate, as
      defined in the subject field).  The subjectPublicKeyInfo field
      also identifies which algorithm to use with the key.

      -  *SCION constraints*: For constraints regarding the algorithm,
         see the signature field.

   *  issuerUniqueID field: it MUST NOT be used in SCION.

   *  subjectUniqueID field: it MUST NOT be used in SCION.

   *  extensions sequence: Defines the extensions of the certificate.
      For a description of all extensions used in SCION, see
      Section 2.2.2.

2.2.1.1.  signature Field - Additional Information

   The signature field contains information about the signature
   algorithm.  Current implementations use the ECDSA signature algorithm
   defined in [X9.62].

   The Object Identifiers (OIDs) for ECDSA are defined as ecdsa-with-
   SHA256, ecdsa-with-SHA384, and ecdsa-with-SHA512 in [RFC5758].

   SCION implementations MUST include support for the ECDSA curves
   below.  Other algorithms or curves MAY be used in the future.

   *  NIST P-256 (NISTFIPS186-4, section D.1.2.3) (named secp256r1 in
      [RFC5480])

   *  NIST P-384 (NISTFIPS186-4, section D.1.2.4) (named secp384r1 in
      [RFC5480])

   *  NIST P-521 (NISTFIPS186-4, section D.1.2.5) (named secp521r1 in
      [RFC5480])

   The OIDs for the above curves are specified in section 2.1.1.1 of
   [RFC5480].

   The appropriate hash size to use when producing a signature with an
   ECDSA key is:

   *  ECDSA with SHA-256, for a P-256 signing key

   *  ECDSA with SHA-384, for a P-384 signing key

   *  ECDSA with SHA-512, for a P-521 signing key

2.2.1.2.  issuer Field - Additional Information

   The issuer field contains the distinguished name (DN) of the CA that
   created the certificate.  [RFC5280], section 4.1.2.4, describes the
   field's syntax and attributes.  In addition to these attributes,
   SCION implementations MUST also support the SCION-specific attribute
   ISD-AS number.  See Section 2.2.1.2.1.

2.2.1.2.1.  ISD-AS number Attribute

   The ISD-AS number attribute identifies the SCION ISD and AS.  In the
   SCION open source implementation, the attribute type is id-at-ia,
   defined as:
   id-at-ia AttributeType ::= {id-scion id-cppki(1) id-at(2) 1}

   where id-scion specifies the root SCION object identifier (OID).

   *Note*: The root SCION object identifier (OID) for the SCION open-
   source implementation is the IANA Private Enterprise Number '55324':
   id-scion ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER {1 3 6 1 4 1 55324}

   The string representation of the ISD-AS number attribute MUST follow
   the text representation defined in [I-D.dekater-scion-controlplane],
   section "Text Representation" where AS numbers in the lower 32-bit
   range are represented in decimal notation, and others in hexadecimal
   notation.

   The ISD-AS number attribute MUST be present exactly once in the
   distinguished name of the certificate issuer or owner, specified in
   the issuer or subject field respectively.  Implementations MUST NOT
   create nor successfully verify certificates whose issuer and subject
   fields do not include the ISD-AS number at all, or include it more
   than once.

   CA certificates MUST include an ISD-AS number in their distinguished
   name so the control plane knows from which AS to retrieve the
   certificate, thereby avoiding circular dependencies.

   *Note*: Voting certificates are not required to include the ISD-AS
   number attribute in their distinguished name.

2.2.2.  Extensions

   [RFC5280], section 4.2.1, defines the syntax of the Extensions
   sequence in a X.509 certificate.  Descriptions of each standard
   certificate extension can be found in [RFC5280], section 4.2.1.  The
   corresponding clauses in [X.509] are clause 7.2 and clause 9,
   respectively.

   Currently, the following extensions are relevant for SCION:

   *  authorityKeyIdentifier

   *  subjectKeyIdentifier

   *  keyUsage

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   *  extKeyUsage

   *  basicConstraints

   The following sections describe the SCION-specifics in regard to
   these extensions.

2.2.2.1.  authorityKeyIdentifier Extension

   The authorityKeyIdentifier extension identifies the public key
   corresponding to the private key used to sign a certificate.

   For the syntax and definition of the authorityKeyIdentifier
   extension, see [RFC5280], section 4.2.1.1, and [X.509], clause
   9.2.2.1.

   The authorityKeyIdentifier extension provides three attributes to
   specify the public key:

   *  keyIdentifier

   *  authorityCertIssuer

   *  authorityCertSerialNumber

   In SCION, using the keyIdentifier attribute is the preferred way to
   specify the authorityKeyIdentifier extension.

   *Important:* SCION implementations MAY also support the use of the
   authorityCertIssuer and authorityCertSerialNumber attributes.
   However, if these attributes are set and support for them is missing,
   implementations SHOULD error out.

   This extension MUST always be non-critical.  However, SCION
   implementations MUST error out if the extension is not present AND
   the certificate is not self-signed.

2.2.2.2.  subjectKeyIdentifier Extension

   The subjectKeyIdentifier extension identifies certificates that
   contain a particular public key.  It can be used, for example, by
   control plane messages to identify which certificate to use for
   verification.  The extension allows for overlapping control plane CA
   keys, for example during updates.

   For the syntax and definition of the subjectKeyIdentifier extension,
   see [RFC5280], section 4.2.1.2, and [X.509], clause 9.2.2.2.

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   This extension MUST always be non-critical.  However, SCION
   implementations MUST error out if the extension is not present.

2.2.2.3.  keyUsage Extension

   The keyUsage extension identifies the intended usage of the public
   key in the corresponding certificate.  For the syntax and definition
   of the keyUsage extension, see [RFC5280], section 4.2.1.3, and
   [X.509], clause 9.2.2.3.

   The attributes of the keyUsage extension define possible ways of
   using the public key.  The attributes have the following meaning in
   SCION:

   *  digitalSignature: The public key can be used to verify the digital
      signature of a control plane payload.

   *  contentCommitment: Not used.

   *  keyEncipherment: Not used.

   *  dataEncipherment: Not used.

   *  keyAgreement: Not used.

   *  keyCertSign: The public key can be used to verify the CA signature
      on a control plane certificate.

   *  cRLSign: Not used.

   *  encipherOnly: Not used.

   *  decipherOnly: Not used.

   *Important:* If a certificate’s public key is used to verify the
   signature of a control plane payload (digitalSignature attribute), it
   MUST be possible to trace back the private key used to sign the
   certificate.  This is done by referencing the ISD-AS and the subject
   key identifier (via the subjectKeyIdentifier extension).  For more
   information about the subjectKeyIdentifier extension, see
   Section 2.2.2.2.

   If present, the keyUsage extension SHOULD be marked as "critical".
   That is, the critical Boolean attribute of this extension MUST be set
   to TRUE (the default is FALSE).

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   *Note*: If a certificate extension is marked "critical", the public
   key in the certificate SHOULD only be used for the purpose set in the
   critical extension.

   Each Control Plane PKI certificate type uses the public key
   differently, and consequently also specifies the attributes of the
   keyUsage extension differently.  The next table shows the
   specifications per certificate type.

    +------------------+-------+---------+---------+------------------+

     Table 3: keyUsage extension - Specifications per certificate type

   (1) The root certificate SHOULD NOT be used to verify control plane
   messages.
   (2) The CA certificate SHOULD NOT be used to verify control plane
   messages.

2.2.2.4.  extKeyUsage Extension

   The extKeyUsage extension specifies additional usages of the public
   key in the certificate.  For the syntax and definition of the
   extKeyUsage extension, see [X.509], clause 9.2.2.4.

   SCION uses the following attributes of the Extended Key Usage
   extension, as defined in Section 4.2.1.12 of [RFC5280]:

   *  id-kp-serverAuth: If set, the public key can be used for SCION
      Control Plane server authentication.

   *  id-kp-clientAuth: If set, the public key can be used for SCION
      Control Plane client authentication.

   *  id-kp-timeStamping: If set, the public key can be used for the
      verification of timestamps.

   Additionally, the Extended Key Usage extension sequence MAY include
   the SCION-specific attributes id-kp-root, id-kp-regular, and id-kp-
   sensitive.  These attributes are used in the TRC setup, to
   distinguish root certificates, regular voting certificates, and
   sensitive voting certificates from each other.  For more information,
   see Section 3.1.2.2.11.

   The specifications of the extKeyUsage extension differ per SCION
   Control Plane PKI certificate type.  The next table provides an
   overview of the specifications per certificate type.

   The id-kp-root, id-kp-regular, and id-kp-sensitive attributes MUST be
   specified as follows:

   *  Root certificate:
      id-kp-root AttributeType ::= {id-scion id-cppki(1) id-kp(3) 3}

   *  Regular voting certificate:
      id-kp-regular AttributeType ::= {id-scion id-cppki(1) id-kp(3) 2}

   *  Sensitive voting certificate:
      id-kp-sensitive AttributeType ::= {id-scion id-cppki(1) id-kp(3)
      1}

   where id-scion specifies the root SCION object identifier (OID).

   *Note*: The root SCION object identifier (OID) for the SCION open-
   source implementation is the IANA Private Enterprise Number '55324':
   id-scion ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER {1 3 6 1 4 1 55324}

2.2.2.5.  basicConstraints Extension

   The basicConstraints extension specifies whether the certificate
   subject may act as a CA.  For the syntax and definition of the
   basicConstraints extension, see [X.509], clause 9.4.2.1.

   The basicConstraints extension includes the following attributes
   relevant for SCION:

   *  cA attribute: Specifies whether the certificate subject may act as
      a CA.  If yes, this attribute MUST be set to TRUE.

   *  pathLenConstraint attribute: This attribute is only relevant if
      the cA attribute is set to TRUE.  It specifies the maximum number
      of CA certificates that may follow this CA certificate in the
      certification chain.  Value "0" means that this CA may only issue
      end-entity certificates, but no CA certificates.  If the attribute
      is not set, there is no limit to the maximum length of the
      certification path.

   The settings of the basicConstraints extension differ for each SCION
   Control Plane PKI certificate type.  The next table shows the
   specifications per certificate type.

3.  Trust Root Configuration Specification

   This section provides an in-depth specification of the Trust Root
   Configuration (TRC) file (see Section 3.1).  The TRC contains policy
   information about an ISD and acts as a distribution mechanism for the
   trust anchors of that ISD.  It enables the securing of control plane
   interactions and is thus an integral part of the SCION
   infrastructure.

   The initial TRC of an ISD is signed during a signing ceremony and
   then distributed throughout the ISD.  This signing ceremony follows
   specific rules; Section 3.2 describes these rules.

3.1.  TRC Specification

   The TRC is a signed collection of [X.509] v3 certificates.
   Additionally, the TRC contains ISD-specific policies encoded in a
   Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] envelope.

   The TRC's certificates collection consists of a set of control plane
   root certificates which build the root of the certification chain for
   the AS certificates in an ISD.  The other certificates in the TRC are
   solely used for signing the next TRC, a process called "voting".  The
   verification of a new TRC thus depends on the policies and voting
   certificates defined in the previous TRC.

   This section specifies the TRC including format definitions and
   dpayload fields.  The section uses the ITU-T [X.680] syntax.

3.1.1.  TRC Types and States

   The following types of TRCs exist:

   *  Initial: The very first TRC of an ISD is the initial TRC of that
      ISD.  It is a special case of the base TRC, where the number of
      the ISD is specified.

   *  Base: A base TRC is either the initial TRC, or the first TRC after
      a trust reset (see Section 1.4.1).  Trust for a base TRC cannot be
      inferred by verifying a TRC update; base TRCs are trusted
      axiomatically, similarly to how root CA certificates are trusted
      by clients in the Web PKI.

   *  Update: All non-base TRCs are updated TRCs.  They are the product
      of either a regular or a sensitive update.

   A TRC can have the following states:

   *  Valid: The validity period of a TRC is defined in the TRC itself,
      in the validity field (see Section 3.1.2.2.3).  A TRC is
      considered valid if the current time falls within its validity
      period.

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   *  Active: An active TRC is a valid TRC that can be used for
      verifying certificate signatures.  This is either the latest TRC
      or the predecessor TRC, if it is still in its grace period (as
      defined in the gracePeriod field of the new TRC, see
      Section 3.1.2.2.4).  No more than two TRCs can be active at the
      same time for any ISD.

   Figure 2 shows the content of both a base/initial TRC, the changes
   made with the first regular update to the base TRC.  All elements of
   the TRC is detailed in the following subsections.

3.1.2.  TRC Format

   The TRC defines the roots of trust of an ISD and is the basis of the
   ISD's Control Plane PKI.  It holds the root and voting certificates
   of the ISD and defines the ISD's trust policy.

3.1.2.1.  TRC Schema

   The following code block shows the format of a TRC specification file
   (the payload schema):

      ASN  ::=  INTEGER (1..281474976710655)

   The TRCPayload sequence contains the identifying information of a TRC
   as well as policy information for TRC updates.  Furthermore, it
   defines the list of certificates that build the trust anchor of the
   ISD.

   For signature calculation, the data that is to be signed is encoded
   using ASN.1 distinguished encoding rules (DER) [X.690].  For more
   details, see Section 3.1.3.

3.1.2.2.  TRC Fields

   This section describes the syntax and semantics of all TRC payload
   fields.

3.1.2.2.1.  version Field

   The version field describes the version of the TRC format
   specification.

   Currently, the version MUST always be "v1".

3.1.2.2.2.  iD Field

   The iD field specifies the unique identifier of the TRC.

   The identifier is a unique sequence of

   *  ISD number (iSD attribute),

   *  base number (baseNumber attribute), and

   *  TRC serial number (serialNumber attribute).

   All numbers MUST be positive integers.

   *  The *ISD number* MUST be an integer in the inclusive range from 64
      to 4094 (i.e., the numbering range for public ISDs, see
      Section 1.6.1).

   *  The *base number* indicates the starting point of the current TRC
      update chain.  This starting point is either the ISD's initial TRC
      or the currently valid base TRC, if the valid base TRC differs
      from the initial TRC.  The latter MUST be the case after a trust
      reset.

   *  The *serial number* represents the current update cycle, counting
      from the initial TRC of a specific ISD.

   A TRC where the base number is equal to the serial number is a base
   TRC.  The initial TRC is a special case of a base TRC and MUST have a
   serial number of 1 and a base number of 1.  With every TRC update,
   the serial number MUST be incremented by one.  This facilitates
   uniquely identifying the predecessor and successor TRC in an update
   chain.

   If a trust reset is necessary, a new base TRC is announced in order
   to start a new and clean TRC update chain.  The base number of this
   new TRC update chain SHOULD be the number following the serial number
   of the latest TRC that was produced by a non-compromised TRC update
   for this ISD.

   *Example*
   The following simple example illustrates how to specify the ID of the
   TRCs in an TRC update chain for _ISD 15_. The IDs are given in a
   human-readable notation, where Bxx is the base number, and Sxx the
   serial number.

                 Table 6: ID of TRCs in TRC update chain

3.1.2.2.3.  validity Field

   The validity field defines the validity period of the TRC.  This is
   the period of time during which the TRC is in the "valid" state.  The
   notBefore and notAfter attributes of the validity field specify the
   lower and upper bound of the time interval during which a TRC can be
   active.

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   *Note:* An active TRC is a valid TRC that can be used for verifying
   certificate signatures.  The time period during which a TRC is active
   can be shorter than the time period during which the TRC is valid.
   For more information, see Section 3.1.1.

   The validity field consists of a sequence of two dates, as defined in
   section 7.2. of [X.509].

   In addition to this standard definition, the following constraint
   applies to the validity field of the TRC:

   *  All TRCs MUST have a well-defined expiration date.  SCION
      implementations MUST NOT create TRCs that use the
      "99991231235959Z" generalized time value, and verifiers MUST error
      out when encountering such a TRC.

3.1.2.2.4.  gracePeriod Field

   The gracePeriod field of a TRC specifies the period of time during
   which the predecessor TRC can still be considered active (the "grace
   period").  The grace period starts at the beginning of the validity
   period of the new TRC.

   The validity period of the predecessor TRC ends when:

   *  the grace period has passed;

   *  the predecessor’s expiration time is reached; or

   *  the successor TRC of the new TRC has been announced.

   *Note:* The event that happens first marks the end of the
   predecessor's validity period.

   The gracePeriod field defines the grace period as a number of seconds
   (positive integer).

   The value of the gracePeriod field in a base TRC MUST be zero.  The
   value of the gracePeriod field in a non-base TRC SHOULD be non-zero.
   It SHOULD be long enough to provide sufficient overlap between the
   TRCs in order to facilitate interruption-free operations in the ISD.
   If the grace period is too short, some Control Plane AS certificates
   might expire before the corresponding AS can fetch an updated version
   from its CA.

3.1.2.2.5.  noTrustReset Boolean

   The noTrustReset Boolean specifies whether a trust reset is forbidden
   by the ISD.  Within a TRC update chain, this value MUST NOT be
   changed by a regular or sensitive update.  However, it is possible to
   change the noTrustReset value in the event of a trust reset, where a
   new base TRC is created.

   The noTrustReset field is OPTIONAL and defaults to FALSE.

   *Important:* Note that once the noTrustReset Boolean is set to TRUE
   and a trust reset is disallowed, this cannot be reversed.  Therefore,
   ISDs SHOULD always set this value to FALSE, unless they have
   sufficiently assessed the risks and implications of making a trust
   reset impossible.

   *Note:* A trust reset represents a special use case where a new base
   TRC is created.  It therefore differs from a TRC update (regular or
   sensitive), as the signatures in the new base TRC cannot be verified
   with the certificates contained in the predecessor TRC.  Instead, a
   trust reset base TRC must be axiomatically trusted, similarly to how
   the initial TRC is trusted.

3.1.2.2.6.  votes Field

   The votes field contains a sequence of indices that refer to the
   voting certificates in the predecessor TRC.  If index i is part of
   the votes field, then the voting certificate at position i in the
   certificates sequence of the predecessor TRC casted a vote on the
   successor TRC.  For more information on the certificates sequence,
   see Section 3.1.2.2.11.

   *Note:* In a base TRC, the votes sequence is empty.

   Every entry in the votes sequence MUST be unique.
   Further restrictions on votes are discussed in Section 3.1.5.

   *Note:* The votes sequence of indices is mandatory in order to
   prevent stripping voting signatures from the TRC.  Absence of the
   votes sequence makes it possible to transform a TRC with more voting
   signatures than the voting quorum into multiple verifiable TRCs with
   the same payload, but different voting signature sets.  This would
   violate the requirement of uniqueness of a TRC.

3.1.2.2.7.  votingQuorum Field

   The votingQuorum field defines the number of necessary votes on a
   successor TRC to make it verifiable.

   A voting quorum greater than one will prevent a single entity from
   creating a malicious TRC update.

3.1.2.2.8.  coreASes Field

   The coreASes field contains the AS numbers of the core ASes in this
   ISD.

   Each core AS number MUST be unique in the sequence of core AS
   numbers.  That is, each AS number MUST appear only once in the
   coreASes field.

3.1.2.2.8.1.  Revoking or Assigning Core Status

   *  To revoke the core status of a given AS, remove the respective AS
      number from the sequence of AS numbers in the coreASes field.

   *  To assign the core status to a given AS, add the respective AS
      number to the sequence of AS numbers in the coreASes field.

   *Important:* Revoking or assigning the core status of/to an AS always
   requires a (sensitive) TRC update.

3.1.2.2.9.  authoritativeASes Field

   The authoritativeASes field contains the AS numbers of the
   authoritative ASes in this ISD.

   Authoritative ASes are those ASes in an ISD that always have the
   latest TRCs of the ISD.  As a consequence, authoritative ASes also
   start the announcement of a TRC update.

   *  Every authoritative AS MUST be a core AS and be listed in the
      coreASes field.

   *  Each authoritative AS number MUST be unique in the sequence of
      authoritative AS numbers.  That is, each AS number MUST NOT appear
      more than once in the authoritativeASes field.

3.1.2.2.9.1.  Revoking or Assigning Authoritative Status

   *  To revoke the authoritative status of a given AS, remove the
      respective AS number from the sequence of AS numbers in the
      authoritativeASes field.

   *  To assign the authoritative status to a given AS, add the
      respective AS number to the sequence of AS numbers in the
      authoritativeASes field.

   *Important:* Revoking or assigning the authoritative status of/to an
   AS always requires a (sensitive) TRC update.

3.1.2.2.10.  description Field

   The description field contains a UTF-8 encoded string that describes
   the ISD.

   *  The description field SHOULD NOT be empty.

   *  The description of the ISD MUST be in English.  Additionally, the
      description field MAY contain information in other languages.

3.1.2.2.11.  certificates Field

   The voting ASes and the certification authorities (CAs) of an ISD are
   not specified explicitly in the ISD's TRC.  Instead, this information
   is defined by the list of voting and root certificates in the
   certificates field of the TRC payload.

   The certificates field is a sequence of self-signed X.509
   certificates.  Each certificate in the certificate sequence MUST be
   one of the following types:

   *  a sensitive voting certificate,

   *  a regular voting certificate, or

   *  a CP root certificate.

   A certificate that is no control plane root or voting certificate
   MUST NOT be included in the sequence of certificates in the
   certificates field.

   *Note*: A certificate's type (voting or root) is specified in the
   extKeyUsage extension of the certificate, by means of the SCION-
   specific attributes id-kp-regular, id-kp-sensitive, and id-kp-root,
   respectively.  For more information, see Section 2.2.2.4.

   The following constraints MUST hold for each certificate in the
   certificates field of the TRC payload:

   *  Each certificate MUST be unique in the sequence of certificates.
      That is, each certificate MUST NOT appear more than once in the
      certificates field.

   *  The issuer / serialNumber pair for each certificate MUST be
      unique.

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   *  If an ISD-AS number is present in the distinguished name of the
      certificate, this ISD number MUST be equal to the ISD number of
      the TRC (which is defined in the iD field (see Section 3.1.2.2.2).

   *  Every certificate MUST have a validity period that fully contains
      the validity period of this TRC.  That is, the notBefore date of
      this TRC's validity period MUST be equal to or later than the
      certificate's notBefore date, and the notAfter date of this TRC's
      validity period MUST be before or equal to the certificate's
      notAfter date.

   *  Per certificate type, every certificate distinguished name MUST be
      unique.

   The following must hold for the entire sequence of certificates in
   the certificates field:

   *  votingQuorum <= count (sensitive voting certificates)
      That is, the quorum defined in the TRC's votingQuorum field
      (Section 3.1.2.2.7) MUST be smaller than or equal to the number of
      _sensitive_ voting certificates specified in the TRC's
      certificates field.

   *  votingQuorum <= count (regular voting certificates)
      That is, the quorum defined in the TRC's votingQuorum field
      (Section 3.1.2.2.7) MUST be smaller than or equal to the number of
      _regular_ voting certificates specified in the TRC's certificates
      field.

3.1.3.  TRC Signature Syntax

   A TRC contains policy information about an ISD and acts as a
   distribution mechanism for the trust anchors of that ISD.

   Each TRC is digitally signed and the syntax used to sign and
   encapsulate the TRC payload is the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
   as defined in [RFC5652].  The signed TRC payload is of the CMS
   signed-data content type, as defined in Section 5 of [RFC5652], and
   encapsulated in a CMS ContentInfo element, as defined in Section 3 of
   [RFC5652].

   For detailed information on the general syntax definitions of the
   Cryptographic Message Syntax, see sections 3 and 5 of [RFC5652].

3.1.3.1.  SCION-specific rules

   SCION implementations MUST fulfil the following additional rules, as
   well as the general syntax rules specified in [RFC5652]:



de Kater, et al.          Expires 10 March 2026                [Page 39]

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   *  EncapsulatedContentInfo sequence:

      -  The eContentType field MUST be set to "id-data".

      -  The content of the eContent field MUST be the DER-encoded TRC
         payload.  This has the benefit that the format is backwards
         compatible with PKCS #7, as described in Section 5.2.1 of
         [RFC5652].

   *  SignedData sequence:

      -  The certificates field MUST be left empty.  The certificate
         pool used to verify a TRC update is already specified in the
         certificates field of the predecessor TRC's payload (see also
         Section 3.1.2.2.11).

      -  The version field MUST be set to "1".  This is because SCION
         uses the "id-data" content type to encapsulate content info,
         and does not specify any certificate in the SignedData sequence
         (see also Section 5.1 of [RFC5652]).

   *  SignerIdentifier choice:

      -  The type of signer identifier chosen here MUST be
         IssuerAndSerialNumber.

   *  SignerInfo sequence:

      -  The version field MUST be set to "1".  This is because SCION
         uses the IssuerAndSerialNumber type of signer identifier (see
         also Section 5.3 of [RFC5652]).

      -  The algorithm specified in the signatureAlgorithm field MUST be
         one of the algorithms supported by SCION (for details, see
         signature Field - Additional Information (Section 2.2.1.1)).

      -  The digestAlgorithm is determined by the algorithm specified in
         the signatureAlgorithm field.

3.1.3.2.  TRC Equality

   The signer information in the signed TRC is part of an unordered set,
   as per [RFC5652].  This implies that the signer information can be
   reordered without affecting verification, although certain operations
   require TRCs to be equal im accordance with the following definition:

   *Two TRCs are equal, if and only if their payloads are byte equal.*




de Kater, et al.          Expires 10 March 2026                [Page 40]

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   Two TRCs with byte equal payloads can be considered as equal because
   the TRC payload exactly defines which signatures must be attached in
   the signed TRC:

   *  The REQUIRED signatures from voting certificates are explicitly
      mentioned in the votes field of the payload: If index "i" is part
      of the votes field, then the voting certificate at position i in
      the certificates sequence of the predecessor TRC casted a vote on
      the successor TRC.  See also Section 3.1.2.2.6.

   *  The REQUIRED signatures for new certificates are implied by the
      currently valid TRC payload, and, in case of a TRC update, the
      predecessor payload.

3.1.4.  Certification Path - Trust Anchor Pool

   The certification path of a Control PlaneAS certificate starts in a
   Control Plane root certificate.  The Control Plane root certificate
   for a given ISD is distributed via the TRC.

   However, AS certificates and the corresponding signing CA
   certificates are *not* part of the TRC, but bundled into certificate
   chains and distributed separately from the corresponding TRC.  This
   separation makes it possible to extend the validity period of the
   root certificate, and to update the corresponding TRC without having
   to modify the certificate chain.  To be able to validate a
   certification path, each AS builds a collection of root certificates
   from the latest TRC of the relevant ISD.

   The following section explains how to build a trust anchor pool.

   *Note:* Any entity sending information that is secured by the Control
   Plane PKI, such as control plane messages, MUST be able to provide
   all the necessary trust material, such as certificates, to verify
   said information.  If any cryptographic material is missing in the
   process, the relying party MUST query the originator of the message
   for the missing material.  If it cannot be resolved, the verification
   process fails.  For more details, see 4.2 "Signing and Verifying
   Control Plane Messages" Section 4.2.

3.1.4.1.  TRC Selection For Trust Anchor Pool

   The selection of the right set of TRCs to build the trust anchor pool
   depends on the time of verification.  The trust anchor pool is
   usually used to verify control plane messages and this case, the time
   of verification is the current time.  However, if the trust anchor
   pool will be used for auditing, the time of verification is the point
   in time to check whether a given signature was verifiable.

3.1.5.  TRC Updates

   All non-base TRCs of an ISD are updates of the ISD's base TRC(s).
   The TRC update chain consists of regular and sensitive TRC updates,
   and the type of update determines the (payload) information that
   changes in the updated TRC.

   This section describes the rules that apply to updating a TRC in
   regard to the payload information contained in the TRC.  Some rules
   are valid for both update types whilst some only apply to a regular
   or a sensitive TRC update.  Based on the type of update, different
   sets of voters are needed to create a verifiable TRC update and the
   corresponding voting (signing) process is also described.  To verify
   a TRC update, a relying party MUST perform a couple of checks which
   are also listed.

3.1.5.1.  Changed or New Certificates

   In the context of a TRC update,

   *  A certificate is _changing_, if the certificate is part of the
      certificates sequence in the predecessor TRC, but no longer part
      of the certificates sequence in the updated TRC.  Instead, the
      certificates sequence of the updated TRC holds another certificate
      of the _same type_ and with the _same distinguished name_.

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   *  A certificate is _new_, if there is *no* certificate of the same
      type and distinguished name at all in the certificates sequence of
      the predecessor TRC.

   *Note:* Every new sensitive or regular voting certificate in a TRC
   attaches a signature to the TRC.  This is done to ensure that the
   freshly included voting entity agrees with the contents of the TRC it
   is now part of.

3.1.5.2.  Update Rules - Overview

   The following table gives an overview of the types of TRC update as
   well as the rules that must apply in regard to the updated TRC's
   payload information.

   The sections that follow provide more detailed descriptions of each
   rule.

3.1.5.3.  General Update Rules

   The following rules MUST hold for each updated TRC, independent of
   the update type:

   *  The iSD and baseNumber in the iD field MUST NOT change (see also
      Section 3.1.2.2.2).

   *  The serialNumber in the iD field MUST be incremented by one.

   *  The noTrustReset field MUST NOT change (see also
      Section 3.1.2.2.5).

   *  The votes sequence of the updated TRC MUST only contain indices
      that refer to sensitive or regular voting certificates in the
      predecessor TRC.  This guarantees that the updated TRC only
      contains valid votes authenticated by sensitive or regular voting
      certificates in the predecessor TRC.  For more information, see
      Section 3.1.2.2.6 and Section 3.1.2.2.11.

   *  The number of votes in the updated TRC MUST be greater than or
      equal to the number set in the votingQuorum field of the
      predecessor TRC (see Section 3.1.2.2.7).  The number of votes
      corresponds to the number of indices in the votes field of the
      updated TRC.

3.1.5.4.  Regular TRC Update

   A regular TRC update is a periodic re-issuance of the TRC where the
   entities and policies listed in the TRC remain unchanged.

   A TRC update qualifies as a regular update, if the following rules
   apply in regard to the TRC's payload information.

   *  The settings of the following fields in the updated TRC MUST
      remain the same compared to the predecessor TRC:

      -  The voting quorum set in the votingQuorum field.

      -  The core ASes specified in the coreASes field.

      -  The authoritative ASes specified in the authoritativeASes
         field.

      -  The number of sensitive and regular voting certificates as well
         as Control Plane root certificates included in the certificates
         field, and their distinguished names.

      -  The set of sensitive voting certificates specified in the
         certificates field.

   *  For every regular voting certificate that changes, the regular
      voting certificate in the predecessor TRC is part of the voters on
      the updated TRC.  That is, for each changed regular voting
      certificate, an index in the votes field of the updated TRC MUST
      refer to the changed regular voting certificate in the predecessor
      TRC.

   *  For every Control Plane root certificate that changes, the updated
      TRC MUST include a signature created with the private key
      belonging to the changed Control Plane root certificate (which is
      part of the predecessor TRC).

   *  In order for a regular TRC update to be verifiable, all votes MUST
      be cast by _regular_ voting certificates.  That is, each index in
      the votes field of the regularly updated TRC MUST refer to a
      _regular_ voting certificate in the certificates field of the
      predecessor TRC.

3.1.5.5.  Sensitive TRC Update

   If a TRC update does not qualify as a regular update, it is
   considered a sensitive update.

   *  In order for a sensitive update to be verifiable, all votes MUST
      be cast by _sensitive_ voting certificates.  That is, each index
      in the votes field of the sensitively updated TRC MUST refer to a
      _sensitive_ voting certificate in the certificates field of the
      predecessor TRC.

3.1.5.6.  Signing a TRC Update

   As described above, a set of voters MUST cast votes on the updated
   TRC to make it verifiable.  The votingQuorum field of the predecessor
   TRC (see Section 3.1.2.2.7) defines the required number of voters,
   which will represent regular or sensitive voting certificates,
   respectively.

   Furthermore, if one or more _new_ certificates are added to the
   updated TRC, the corresponding voting representatives MUST also sign
   the updated TRC in order to show that they have access to the private
   keys listed in these fresh certificates.  This is called "showing
   proof-of-possession", and done by signing the TRC with the respective
   private key.  For the distinction between changed and new
   certificates in a TRC update, see Section 3.1.5.1.

   It is up to the ISD members to decide how the "casting a vote"
   procedure for updated TRCs will take place.  Some ISDs will make a
   distinction between regular and sensitive updates.  These ISDs divide
   the regular and sensitive signing keys in different security classes
   and act accordingly, e.g. they keep the regular key in an online
   vault while the sensitive key would be stored offline.  This way, the
   regular TRC update would lend itself to being automated (since the
   keys are accessible online) whereas the sensitive one would require
   manual actions to access the offline key.  However, other ISDs keep
   both regular and sensitive keys online and perform both updates
   automatically.

3.1.5.7.  TRC Update Verification

   To verify a TRC update, the relying party MUST perform the following
   checks:

   *  Check that the specified update rules as described above are
      respected.

   *  Check whether the update is regular or sensitive.

      -  In case of a regular update,

         o  check that the signatures for the changing certificates are
            present and verifiable, and

         o  check that all votes are cast by a regular voting
            certificate.

      -  In case of a sensitive update, check that all votes are cast by
         a sensitive voting certificate.

   *  In both cases, check that all signatures are verifiable, and no
      superfluous signatures are attached.

   If one or more of the above checks gives a negative result, the
   updated TRC SHOULD be rejected.

3.2.  Initial TRC Signing Ceremony

   The very first base TRC of an ISD - called the initial TRC - is a
   special case of the base TRC where the number of the ISD is chosen.
   The initial TRC MUST be signed during a special signing ceremony -
   all voting representatives of the initial TRC need to take part in
   this signing ceremony to sign this and exchange their public keys.
   Following this, all entities within an ISD can obtain the TRC by
   means of a secure offline or online mechanism.

   Appendix "Appendix A.  Signing Ceremony Initial TRC" describes a
   possible procedure for the signing ceremony of an ISD's initial TRC.
   It is in principle up to the initial members of an ISD how to
   organize the signing ceremony.  However, it is recommended having a
   process in line with the ceremony described in the Appendix.

4.  Deploying the CP PKI - Specifications

   This section provides several specifications regarding the deployment
   of the control plane PKI.

4.1.  Deploying a TRC

4.1.1.  Base TRC

   Base TRCs are trust anchors and thus axiomatically trusted.  All ASes
   within an ISD MUST be pre-loaded with the currently valid base-
   version TRC of their own ISD.  For all specifications regarding the
   creation and distribution of initial/base TRCs, see Section 3.2.

4.1.2.  TRC Update

   All non-base TRCs of an ISD are updates of the ISD's base TRC(s).
   The TRC update chain consists of regular and sensitive TRC updates.
   The specifications and rules that apply to updating a TRC are
   described in Section 3.1.5.

4.1.2.1.  TRC Update Discovery

   Relying parties MUST have at least one valid TRC available.  Relying
   parties MUST discover TRC updates within the grace period defined in
   the updated TRC.  They SHOULD discover TRC updates in a matter of
   minutes to hours.  Additionally, the following requirement MUST be
   satisfied:

   *Requirement*
   Any entity sending information that is secured by the Control Plane
   PKI MUST be able to provide all the necessary trust material to
   verify said information.

   SCION provides the following mechanisms for discovering TRC updates
   and fulfilling the above requirement:

   *  _Beaconing Process_
      The TRC version is announced in the beaconing process.  Each AS
      MUST announce what it considers to be the latest TRC, and MUST
      include the hash value of the TRC contents to facilitate the
      discovery of discrepancies.  Therefore, relying parties that are



de Kater, et al.          Expires 10 March 2026                [Page 49]

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


      part of the beaconing process discover TRC updates passively, i.e.
      a core AS notices TRC updates for remote ISDs that are on the
      beaconing path.  A non-core AS only notices TRC updates for the
      local ISD through the beaconing process.  The creation of a new
      TRC SHOULD trigger the generation of new control plane messages,
      as the propagation of control plane messages will help other ASes
      rapidly discover the new TRC.

   *  _Path Lookup_
      In every path segment, all ASes MUST reference the latest TRC of
      their ISD.  Therefore, when resolving paths, every relying party
      will notice TRC updates, even remote ones.

   *  _Active Discovery_
      Any TRC can be obtained at any time from the sender of the
      information it secures; either in a specific version or in its
      latest available version.  The necessary query and response is
      described in [I-D.dekater-scion-controlplane], section "Control
      Service gRPC API - Trust Material".

   *Note:* The first two mechanisms above only work when there is active
   communication between the relying party and the ISD in question.

4.2.   Signing and Verifying Control Plane Messages

   SCION requires that control plane messages are signed.  The main
   purpose of the Control Plane PKI is providing a mechanism to
   distribute and authenticate public keys that are used to verify
   control plane messages and information, e.g. each hop information in
   a path segment is signed by the respective AS.  Consequently, all
   relying parties MUST be able to verify signatures with the help of
   the Control Plane PKI.

   The following sections specify the requirements that apply to the
   signing and verification of control plane messages.

4.2.1.  Signing a Control Plane Message

   An AS signs control plane messages with the private key that
   corresponds to the (valid) AS' certificate.

   The AS MUST attach the following information as signature metadata.
   It is the minimum information a relying party requires to identify
   which certificate to use to verify the signed message.

   *  ISD-AS number: The ISD-AS number of the signing entity.  For
      specification details, see Section 2.2.1.2.1.




de Kater, et al.          Expires 10 March 2026                [Page 50]

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   *  Subject key identifier: The identifier of the public key that MUST
      be used to verify the message.  For specification details, see
      Section 2.2.2.2.

   Additionally, the signer SHOULD include the following information:

   *  Serial and base number of the latest TRC: Including this
      information allows relying parties to discover TRC updates and
      trust resets.  For specification details, see Section 3.1.2.2.2.

   *  Timestamp: For many messages, the time at which it was signed is
      useful information to ensure freshness.

4.2.2.  Verifying a Control Plane Message

   When the relying party receives a control plane message they want to
   verify, the relying party first needs to identify the certificate
   needed to validate the corresponding signature on the message.

   AS certificates are bundled together with the corresponding signing
   CA certificate into certificate chains.  For efficiency, SCION
   distributes these certificate chains separately from the signed
   messages.

   A certificate chain is verified against the Control Plane root
   certificate, although the the root certificate is bunded with the TRC
   and *not* in the chain.  This makes it possible to extend the
   validity period of the root certificate and update the corresponding
   TRC without having to modify the certificate chain.

   To verify a control plane message, the relying party MUST perform the
   following steps:

   1.  Build a collection of root certificates from the latest TRC of
       the relevant ISD (that is, the ISD referenced in the signature
       metadata of the message).  If the grace period (see
       Section 3.1.2.2.4) introduced by the latest TRC is still on-
       going, the root certificates in the second-to-latest TRC MUST
       also be included.  For a description on how to build the correct
       collection of certificates, see Section 3.1.4.1.

   2.  If the signature metadata of the message contains the serial and
       base number of the latest TRC, the relying party MUST check that
       they have this latest TRC.  If not, the relying party MUST
       request the latest TRC.

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   3.  After constructing the pool of root certificates, the relying
       party MUST select the certificate chain used to verify the
       message.  The AS certificate included in this certificate chain
       MUST have the following properties:

       *  The ISD-AS number in the subject of the AS certificate MUST
          match the ISD-AS number in the signature metadata.  See also
          Section 2.2.1.2.1.

       *  The subject key identifier of the AS certificate MUST match
          the subject key identifier in the signature metadata.  See
          also Section 2.2.2.2.

       *  The AS certificate MUST be valid at verification time.
          Normally, this will be the current time.  In special cases,
          e.g., auditing, the time can be set to the past to check if
          the message was verifiable at the given time.

   4.  After selecting a certificate chain to verify the control plane
       messages, the relying party MUST verify the certificate chain,
       by:

       *  Executing the regular X.509 verification procedure.  For
          details, see [X.509].

       *  Checking that

          -  all subjects of the certificates in the chain carry the
             same ISD number (see also Section 2.2.1.2.1,

          -  each certificate is of the correct type (see also
             Section 2.1), and

          -  the CA certificate validity period covers the AS
             certificate validity period.

   5.  If the verification of the certificate chain was successful, the
       relying party can now verify the control plane messages, with the
       root certificates from the certificate chain.

   If any cryptographic material is missing in the process, the relying
   party MUST query the originator of the message for the missing
   material.  If it cannot be resolved, the verification process fails.

   *Important:* An implication of the above procedure is that path
   segments SHOULD be verifiable at time of use.  It is not enough to
   rely on path segments being verified on insert since TRC updates that
   change the root key can invalidate a certificate chain.

4.3.  Creating a New Control Plane AS Certificate

   The steps REQUIRED to create a new AS certificate are the following:

   1.  The AS creates a new key pair and a certificate signing request
       (CSR) using that key pair.

   2.  The AS sends the certificate signing request to the relevant CA
       within the ISD.

   3.  The CA uses its CA key and the CSR to create the new AS
       certificate.

   4.  The CA sends the AS certificate back to the AS.

   When an AS joins an ISD, the first CSR is sent out of band to one of
   the CAs as part of the formalities to join the ISD.  Subsequent
   certificate renewals MAY be automated and can leverage the control
   plane communication infrastructure.

5.  Security Considerations

   The goal of SCION is to provide a secure inter-domain network
   architecture, therefore this section focuses on _inter_-AS security
   considerations.  All _intra_-AS trust- and security aspects are out
   of scope.

5.1.  Dependency on Certificates

   In PKIs, CAs have both the responsibility and power to issue and
   revoke certificates.  A compromised or misbehaving CA could refuse to
   issue certificates to legitimate entities and/or issue illegitimate
   certificates to allow impersonation of another entity.  In the
   context of the Control Plane PKI, refusing to issue or renew a
   certificate to an AS will ultimately cut that AS off from the
   network, turning the Control Plane PKI into a potential network kill
   switch, so within each ISD there are usually multiple independent
   CAs.

   SCION fundamentally differs from a global monopolistic trust model as
   each ISD manages its own trust roots instead of a single global
   entity providing those roots.  This structure gives each ISD autonomy
   in terms of key management and in terms of trust, and prevents the
   occurrence of a global kill switch affecting all ISDs at once.
   However, each ISD is still susceptible to compromises that could
   affect or halt other components (control plane and forwarding).

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


5.1.1.  Compromise of an ISD

   In SCION there is no central authority that could "switch off" an ISD
   as each relies on its own independent trust roots.  Each AS within an
   ISD is therefore dependant on its ISD's PKI for its functioning,
   although the following compromises are potentially possible:

   *  At TRC level: The private root keys of the root certificates
      contained in an TRC are used to sign CA certificates.  If one of
      these private root keys is compromised, the adversary could issue
      illegitimate CA certificates which may be used in further attacks.
      To maliciously perform a TRC update, an attacker would need to
      compromise multiple voting keys, the number of which is dependent
      on the voting quorum set in the TRC - the higher the quorum, the
      more unlikely a malicious update will be.

   *  At CA level: The private keys of an ISD's CA certificates are used
      to sign the AS certificates and all ASes within an ISD obtain
      certificates directly from the CAs.  If one of the CA’s keys is
      compromised, an adversary could issue illegitimate AS
      certificates, which may be used in further attacks.

   *  At AS level: Each AS within an ISD signs control plane messages
      with their AS private key.  If the keys of an AS are compromised
      by an adversary, this adversary can illegitimately sign control
      plane messages including Path Construction Beacons (PCBs).  This
      means that the adversary can manipulate the PCBs and propagate
      them to neighboring ASes or register/store them as path segments.

5.1.2.  Recovery from Compromise

   This section deals with possible recovery from the compromises
   discussed in the previous paragraph.  As described in Section 1.4.2,
   there is no revocation in the Control Plane PKI.

   *  At TRC level: If any of the root keys or voting keys contained in
      the TRC are compromised, the TRC MUST be updated as described in
      Section 3.1.5.  A trust reset is only required in the case the
      number of compromised keys at the same time is greater or equal
      than the TRC's quorum (see Section 3.1.2.2.7) and a invalid update
      has been produced and distributed in the network.

   *  At CA level: If the private key related to a CA certificate is
      compromised, the impacted CA AS MUST obtain a new CA certificate
      from the corresponding root AS.  CA certificates are generally
      short lived to limit the impact of compromise.  Alternatively,
      with a TRC update, a new root keys can also be forced,
      invalidating the compromised CA.



de Kater, et al.          Expires 10 March 2026                [Page 54]

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   *  At AS level: In the event of a key compromise of a (non-core) AS,
      the impacted AS needs to obtain a new certificate from its CA.
      This process will vary depending on internal issuance protocols.

5.2.  Denial of Service Attacks

   The Control Plane PKI lays the foundation for the authentication
   procedures in SCION by providing each AS within a specific ISD with a
   certified key pair.  These keys enable the authentication of all
   control plane messages - every AS and endpoint can verify all control
   plane messages by following the certificate chain.

   The relying party MUST be able to discover and obtain new or updated
   cryptographic material.  For the control plane messages, this is
   simplified by the observation that the sender of a message (e.g. of a
   path construction beacon during path exploration or a path segment
   during a path lookup) always has all the cryptographic material to
   verify it.  Thus, the receiver can always immediately obtain all the
   cryptographic material from the message originator.  As the
   corresponding PKI messaging thus only occurs when the control plane
   is already communicating, these requests to obtain cryptographic
   material are not prone to additional denial of service attacks.  We
   therefore refer to [I-D.dekater-scion-controlplane] for a more
   detailed description of DoS vulnerabilities of control-plane
   messages.

   For certificate renewal, on the other hand, this does not apply.
   Denial of Service on the CA infrastructure or on the communication
   links from the individual ASes to the CA could be used by an attacker
   to prevent victim ASes from renewing their certificates, halting the
   path discovery process.  This risk can be mitigated in multiple ways:

   *  CAs only need to be accessible from ASes within the ISD, reducing
      the potential DoS attack surface

   *  ISDs usually rely on multiple CAs

   *  ISDs could create policies and processes to renew certificates
      out-of-band

6.  IANA Considerations

Deployment Testing: SCIONLab

   SCIONLab is a global research network that is available to test the
   SCION architecture.  You can create and use your ASes using your own
   computation resources which allows you to gain real-world experience
   of deploying and managing a SCION network.

   More information can be found on the SCIONLab website and in the
   [SCIONLAB] paper.

Appendix A.  Signing Ceremony Initial TRC

   A Signing Ceremony is used to create the initial (first) Trust Root
   Configuration of an ISD.  Each ISD may decide how to conduct this
   ceremony, but it is RECOMMENDED to establish a procedure similar to
   the one described below:

 Ceremony Participants

   The Signing Ceremony SHOULD include the following participants:

   *  *Ceremony Administrator* - an individual in charge of moderating
      the signing process, guiding the participants through the steps,
      and acting as an intermediary for sharing information.  The
      Ceremony Administrator is typically appointed by the ISD Manager
      or by resolution of the Voting ASes.

   *  *Voting AS Representatives* - individuals representing each Voting
      AS who are able to create voting signatures on the TRC.  They are
      in possession of a device with the private keys of their
      respective certificates in the TRC.

   *  *Witness(es)* - individual(s) who have no active role in the
      Signing Ceremony but may stop the process and request more
      information if they feel its integrity may have been compromised.
      The Witness(es) are typically appointed by resolution of the
      Voting ASes.

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   *Note:* The ISD members MUST decide on the roles of the Signing
   Ceremony participants in advance of Signing Ceremony, and MUST have
   reached agreement about the Certificate Authority (CA) ASes (that
   will also issue the root certificates).  It is assumed that all
   parties are trustworthy and issues encountered during the Signing
   Ceremony may be assumed to be caused by honest mistakes and not by
   malicious intent.  Hash comparison checks are included to counter
   mistakes and so that every participant can ensure they are operating
   on the same data, and the private keys of each participant never
   leave their machine.  The Ceremony Administrator does not have to be
   entrusted with private keys.

Ceremony Preparations

   The participants MUST decide in advance on the physical location of
   the Signing Ceremony, the devices that will be used, and the ISD
   policy as follows:

   *  ISD number - usually obtained from the SCION registry, see
      Section 3.1.2.2.2;

   *  The description of the TRC, see Section 3.1.2.2.10;

   *  Validity period of the TRC, see Section 3.1.2.2.3;

   *  Voting quorum for the TRC, see Section 3.1.2.2.7;

   *  AS numbers of the Core ASes, see Section 3.1.2.2.8;

   *  AS numbers of the Authoritative ASes, see Section 3.1.2.2.9;

   *  The list of Control Plane Root Certificates.

   Each representative of a Voting AS MUST also create the following
   before the ceremony:

   *  A sensitive voting private key and a certificate holding the
      corresponding public key.

   *  A regular voting private key and a certificate holding the
      corresponding public key.

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   In addition, each Certificate Authority MUST create a control plane
   root private key and a certificate holding the corresponding public
   key.  A representative of the Certificate Authority need not be
   present at the ceremony as they do not need to sign the TRC, but they
   MUST provide their root certificate to be shared at the ceremony.
   The validity period of the certificates generated in advance MUST
   cover the full TRC validity period.

   The location MUST provide electricity and power sockets for each
   participant, and should provide a monitor or projector that allows
   the Ceremony Administrator to display proceedings.

   The Ceremony Administrator and Voting ASes MUST each bring to the
   Signing Ceremony a secure machine capable of signing and verifying
   TRCs and computing the SHA-512 digest of the files.  For voting ASes,
   the machine requires access to their own sensitive and regular voting
   private keys.

   The Ceremony Administrator MUST provide or be provided with a device
   to exchange data between the ceremony participants.

   The Signing Ceremony SHOULD include a procedure to verify that all
   devices are secure.

 Ceremony Process

   The number of Voting ASes present at the Signing Ceremony must be
   equal to or larger than the specified voting quorum.

   The signing process has four phases of data sharing, led by the
   Ceremony Administrator who provides instructions to the other
   participants:

Phase 1: Certificate Exchange

   All parties share the certificates that must be part of the TRC with
   the Ceremony Administrator.  For the Voting ASes, these are the
   sensitive and the regular voting certificates, and for the
   Certificate Authority these are the Control Plane root certificates.

   Each representative copies the requested certificates from their
   machine onto a data exchange device provided by the Ceremony
   Administrator that is passed between all representatives, before
   being returned to the Ceremony Administrator.  Representatives MUST
   NOT copy the corresponding private keys onto the data exchange device
   as this invalidates the security of the ceremony.

Internet-Draft                SCION CP-PKI                September 2025


   The Ceremony Administrator then checks that the validity period of
   each provided certificate covers the previously agreed upon TRC
   validity, that the signature algorithms are correct, and that the
   certificate type is valid (root, sensitive voting or regular voting
   certificate).  If these parameters are correct, the Ceremony
   Administrator computes the SHA256 hash value for each certificate,
   aggregates and bundles all the provided certificates, and finally
   calculates the SHA512 hash value for the entire bundle.  All hash
   values must be displayed to the participants.

   The Ceremony Administrator MUST then share the bundle with the
   representatives of the voting ASes who MUST validate on their machine
   that the hash value of their certificates and that of the bundled
   certificates is the same as displayed by the Ceremony Administrator.

   Phase 1 concludes when every representative has confirmed the SHA256
   sums are correct.  If there is any mismatch then this phase MUST be
   repeated.

Phase 2: Generation of the TRC Payload

   The Ceremony Administrator generates the TRC payload based on the
   bundled certificates and the Section 3.1.2.2 completed in accordance
   with ISD policy, see Appendix "Ceremony Preparations".

   Once the voting representatives have verified the TRC data, the
   Ceremony Administrator computes the DER encoding of the data
   according to Section 3.1.2.1 and the SHA256 hash value of the TRC
   payload file.  The TRC payload file is then shared with the voting
   representatives via the data exchange device who verify the TRC
   payload hash value by computing this on their machine and checking it
   matches the one displayed by the Ceremony Administrator.

   Phase 2 concludes when all voting representatives confirm that the
   contents of the TRC payload are correct.

Phase 3: TRC Signing

   Each voting representative attaches a signature created with their
   own private voting key to the TRC (payload file), using their own
   machine.  This serves to prove possession of the private keys.

   Phase 3 concludes when all voting representatives have attached their
   signatures to the TRC.

Phase 4: TRC Validation

   All voting representatives copy the TRC payload signed with their
   private voting keys to the data exchange device and return this to
   the Ceremony Administrator.  The Ceremony Administrator assembles the
   final TRC by aggregating the payload data and verifying the
   signatures based on the certificates exchanged during Phase 1.  The
   Ceremony Administrator then shares the assembled TRC with all
   participants who MUST again inspect the signatures and verify them
   based on the certificates exchanged in Phase 1.

   The Signing Ceremony is completed once when every voting
   representative confirms that the signatures match.  All participants
   can then use the TRC to distribute trust anchors for the ISD.
